        <p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong></p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Liability for Content</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The content of our pages was created with the utmost care. However, we
          cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the
          content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content
          on these pages according to § 7 para.1 DDG under general laws.
          According to §§ 8 to 10 DDG, we are not obligated as a service
          provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or
          to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
          Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general
          laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only
          possible from the time of knowledge of a specific legal violation.
          Upon becoming aware of such violations, we will remove this content
          immediately.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Liability for Links</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our offer contains links to external third-party websites, on whose
          content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any
          liability for these external contents. The respective provider or
          operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the
          linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal
          violations at the time of linking. Illegal content was not
          recognizable at the time of linking. Permanent monitoring of the
          content of the linked pages is, however, unreasonable without concrete
          evidence of a violation. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we
          will remove such links immediately.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Copyright</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
          subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing,
          distribution, and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of
          copyright require the written consent of the respective author or
          creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only permitted for
          private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this page was
          not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
          respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such.
          Should you still become aware of a copyright infringement, we ask for
          a corresponding notice. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, we
          will remove such content immediately.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p><strong>Data Protection</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The use of our website is usually possible without providing personal
          data. Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address, or email
          addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a
          voluntary basis as far as possible. These data will not be passed on
          to third parties without your explicit consent. <br />
          We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g.,
          communication by email) can have security gaps. Complete protection of
          data from access by third parties is not possible. <br />
          The use of contact data published as part of the imprint obligation by
          third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information
          materials is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages
          expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the case of
          unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.
