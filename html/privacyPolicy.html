        <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> Below, you will
          find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process
          personal data. Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the
          GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of
          residence or business location may also apply. If more specific legal
          bases are relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of them in
          our privacy policy.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has
            given their consent to the processing of their personal data for a
            specific purpose or multiple specified purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Contract fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b)
              GDPR)</strong
            >
            - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which
            the data subject is a party, or to take steps at the request of the
            data subject prior to entering into a contract.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong>
            - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
            interests pursued by the controller or a third party, provided that
            the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject
            requiring protection of personal data do not override those
            interests.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In
          addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in
          Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act
          (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG), which provides specific regulations
          on the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to object, the
          processing of special categories of personal data, processing for
          other purposes, data transfers, and automated individual
          decision-making, including profiling. Additionally, data protection
          laws of individual federal states may also apply.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>National data protection regulations in Austria: </strong>In
          addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in
          Austria. This includes, in particular, the Federal Act on the
          Protection of Natural Persons in the Processing of Personal Data (Data
          Protection Act – DSG). The Data Protection Act contains specific
          provisions on the right of access, the right to rectification or
          erasure, the processing of special categories of personal data,
          processing for other purposes, data transfers, and automated
          individual decision-making.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >Relevant legal bases under the Swiss Data Protection Act: </strong
          >If you are located in Switzerland, we process your data based on the
          Federal Act on Data Protection (Swiss FADP). Unlike the GDPR, the
          Swiss FADP generally does not require a legal basis to be specified
          for data processing. Instead, personal data must be processed in good
          faith, lawfully, and proportionately (Art. 6(1) and (2) Swiss FADP).
          Additionally, personal data is only collected for a specific,
          recognizable purpose for the data subject and is processed only in a
          way that is compatible with that purpose (Art. 6(3) Swiss FADP).
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Note on applicability of GDPR and Swiss FADP: </strong>These
          privacy notices serve to provide information under both the Swiss FADP
          and the GDPR. For broader applicability and ease of understanding, the
          terminology of the GDPR is used. Specifically, instead of the terms
          used in the Swiss FADP, such as “processing” of “personal data,”
          “overriding interest,” and “particularly sensitive personal data,” the
          GDPR terms “processing” of “personal data,” “legitimate interest,” and
          “special categories of data” are used. However, the legal meaning of
          the terms remains defined by the Swiss FADP within its scope of
          application.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in
          accordance with legal requirements, considering the state of the art,
          implementation costs, the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes
          of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of
          threats to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a
          level of security appropriate to the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality,
          integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and
          electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, transmission,
          availability security, and separation of the data. Furthermore, we
          have established procedures that allow for the exercise of data
          subject rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats.
          Additionally, we consider the protection of personal data during the
          development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures,
          following the principles of data protection by design and by default.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of processing personal data, we may transfer or disclose
          such data to other entities, companies, legally independent
          organizations, or individuals. Recipients of this data may include
          service providers responsible for IT-related tasks or providers of
          services and content integrated into a website. In such cases, we
          comply with legal requirements and conclude contracts or agreements
          with the recipients to protect your data.
        </p>

        <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Data processing in third countries:</strong> If we process
          data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU) or the
          European Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing occurs in the context
          of using third-party services or disclosing or transferring data to
          other entities, persons, or companies, this is done only in accordance
          with legal requirements. If an adequacy decision has been issued for
          the third country (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the
          data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only take place if an
          adequate level of data protection is ensured in other ways,
          particularly through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c)
          GDPR), explicit consent, or in cases of contractual or legally
          required transfers (Art. 49(1) GDPR). In addition, we inform you about
          the legal basis for third-country transfers in relation to individual
          third-country providers, with adequacy decisions taking precedence.
          Information on third-country transfers and applicable adequacy
          decisions can be found on the European Commission's website:
          <a

        <p>
          Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission
          has also recognized the level of data protection for certain U.S.
          companies as adequate under its adequacy decision of 07/10/2023. The
          list of certified companies and further information about the DPF can
          be found on the U.S. Department of Commerce website:

          <strong>Disclosure of personal data abroad:</strong> According to the
          Swiss Data Protection Act (Swiss FADP), we only transfer personal data

          adequate protection (list:

          international treaties, specific guarantees, data protection clauses
          in contracts, standard data protection clauses approved by the Swiss
          Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), or

          According to Art. 16 of the Swiss FADP, exceptions for international
          data transfers may be granted under certain conditions, such as the
          consent of the data subject, contract fulfillment, public interest,
          protection of life or physical integrity, publicly available data, or
          data from legally mandated registers. Such disclosures always comply

        <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal
          regulations as soon as the underlying consent is revoked or no other
          legal basis for processing exists. This applies when the original
          purpose of processing is no longer applicable or the data is no longer
          needed. Exceptions to this rule exist when legal obligations or
          particular interests require extended retention or archiving of the
          data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, data that must be retained for commercial or tax law
          reasons or that is necessary for legal prosecution or the protection
          of the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our privacy notices include additional information about data
          retention and deletion policies that apply specifically to certain
          processing operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          If multiple retention periods or deletion deadlines apply to a piece
          of data, the longest period is always authoritative.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a retention period does not explicitly begin on a specified date
          and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the
          calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurs. In the
          case of ongoing contractual relationships where data is stored, the
          event triggering the retention period is the date the termination or
          other legal conclusion of the contractual relationship takes effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data that is no longer required for its original purpose but must be
          retained due to legal obligations or other reasons is processed only
          for the purposes justifying its retention.

        <p>
          The term "cookies" refers to features that store information on the
          user's devices and retrieve it. Cookies can also be used for various
          purposes, such as functionality, security, and comfort of online
          services, as well as for creating analysis of visitor flows. We use
          cookies in accordance with legal requirements. For this purpose, we
          obtain the user's consent in advance if necessary. If consent is not
          required, we rely on our legitimate interests. This applies when
          storing and retrieving information is essential to provide explicitly
          requested content and functions. This includes, for example, saving
          settings and ensuring the functionality and security of our online
          services. Consent can be revoked at any time. We clearly inform about
          the scope and which cookies are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Notes on Data Protection Legal Basis:</strong> Whether we
          process personal data using cookies depends on consent. If consent is
          given, it serves as the legal basis. Without consent, we rely on our
          legitimate interests, which are explained earlier in this section and

            application).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permanent Cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored
            even after the device is closed. For example, the login status can
            be saved, and preferred content can be directly displayed when the
            user visits a website again. Similarly, user data collected via

            explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies
            (e.g., during the collection of consent), users should assume that
            these cookies are permanent and can be stored for up to two years.

            <strong>Processing of Cookie Data Based on Consent:</strong> We use
            a consent management solution to obtain users' consent for the use
            of cookies or for the procedures and providers mentioned in the
            consent management solution. This procedure is used to collect, log,
            manage, and withdraw consent, particularly regarding the use of
            cookies and similar technologies that are used to store, read, and
            process information on the user's devices. As part of this
            procedure, users' consent for the use of cookies and the associated
            processing of information, including the specific processes and
            providers mentioned in the consent management process, is obtained.
            Users also have the option to manage and withdraw their consent. The
            consent declarations are stored to avoid asking for consent again
            and to be able to provide proof of consent in accordance with legal
            requirements. The storage is done server-side and/or in a cookie

        <p>
          Web analysis (also referred to as "reach measurement") is used to
          evaluate the visitor traffic to our online services and can include
          behavior, interests, or demographic information about the visitors,
          such as age or gender, as pseudonymous data. With the help of reach
          analysis, we can, for example, identify when our online services or
          their functions or content are used most frequently or when a revisit
          is likely. It also allows us to understand which areas need
          optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to web analysis, we may also use testing procedures to
          test and optimize different versions of our online services or their
          components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless stated otherwise below, profiles, which are data grouped
          together for a usage process, may be created, and information can be
          stored in a browser or on a device and then read. The data collected
          includes visited websites and used elements, as well as technical
          information such as the browser used, the computer system used, and
          information about usage times. If users have consented to the
          collection of their location data with us or with the providers of the
          services we use, location data may also be processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the IP addresses of users are stored. However, we use an
          IP masking process (i.e., pseudonymization by truncating the IP
          address) to protect users. Generally, no clear user data (e.g., email
          addresses or names) is stored as part of web analysis, A/B testing,
          and optimization, but pseudonyms are used. This means that neither we
          nor the providers of the software used know the actual identity of the
          users, but only the information stored in their profiles for the
          specific procedures.

            <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to

            pseudonymous user identification number. This identification number
            does not contain any unique data, such as names or email addresses.
            It is used to assign analytical data to a device in order to
            recognize which content users have accessed within a single or
            multiple sessions, which search terms they have used, re-accessed,
            or interacted with our online services. Additionally, the time of
            use and its duration are stored, as well as the sources that refer
            users to our online services and technical aspects of their devices
            and browsers.<br />
            Pseudonymous user profiles are created using information from the
            use of different devices, with cookies potentially being used.
            Google Analytics does not log or store individual IP addresses for
            EU users. However, Analytics provides rough geographical location
            data by deriving the following metadata from IP addresses: city (and
            the derived latitude and longitude of the city), continent, country,
            region, subcontinent (and ID-based counterparts). For EU traffic, IP
            address data is only used for the derivation of geolocation data and
            is immediately deleted thereafter. They are not logged, are not
            accessible, and are not used for other purposes. When Google
            Analytics collects measurement data, all IP queries are carried out
            on EU-based servers before the traffic is forwarded to Analytics
            servers for processing; <strong>Service Provider:</strong> Google

        <p>
          We integrate functional and content elements into our online services
          that are sourced from the servers of their respective providers
          (hereinafter referred to as "third parties"). These can include, for
          example, graphics, videos, or maps (collectively referred to as
          "content").
        </p>
        <p>
          The integration always requires that the third-party providers of this
          content process the users' IP addresses, as they cannot send the
          content to the users' browsers without the IP address. The IP address
          is thus necessary for the display of these contents or functions. We
          strive to only use content whose respective providers apply the IP
          address solely for delivering the content. Third parties may also use
          so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons")
          for statistical or marketing purposes. Through "pixel tags,"
          information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this website
          can be evaluated. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in

            <strong>Google Fonts (Sourced from Google Server):</strong> Fonts
            (and symbols) are sourced for the purpose of technically secure,
            maintenance-free, and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard
            to currentness and load times, uniform display, and consideration of
            possible copyright restrictions. The font provider receives the
            user's IP address to make the fonts available in the user's browser.
            Additionally, technical data (language settings, screen resolution,
            operating system, used hardware) are transmitted, which are
            necessary for providing the fonts depending on the devices and
            technical environment used. This data may be processed on a server
            of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online services,
            users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts
            Web API (i.e., a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The
            Google Fonts Web API provides the users with the Cascading Style
            Sheets (CSS) from Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the
            CSS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the
            respective user to access the internet, (2) the requested URL on the
            Google server, and (3) the HTTP headers, including the User-Agent,
            which describes the browser and operating system versions of the
            website visitors, as well as the referring URL (i.e., the website on
            which the Google font is to be displayed). IP addresses are neither
            logged nor stored on Google servers, and they are not analyzed. The
            Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested
            URL, User-Agent, and referring URL). Access to this data is
            restricted and tightly controlled. The requested URL identifies the
            font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is
            logged so that Google can determine how often a specific font family
            is requested. The User-Agent is primarily logged for debugging and
            used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the
            popularity of font families. These summarized usage statistics are
            published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the
            referring URL is logged so that the data can be used for production
            maintenance and an aggregated report of top integrations based on
            the number of font requests can be generated. According to Google,
            none of the data collected by Google Fonts is used to create user
            profiles or display targeted ads;
